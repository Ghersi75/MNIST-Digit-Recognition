# MNIST-Digit-Recognition

This repo will be used to learn the basics on pytorch with the MNIST dataset

Basically the "Hello World" of Machine Learning

To make this work locally, I ran 
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
This command was taken from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
